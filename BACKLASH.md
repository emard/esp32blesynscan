# Backlash Reduction

Backlash is annoying accumulated mechanical energy
in motor tranmission which visually manifests as
telescope first goes a few arc minutes in counter
direction than it goes in correct direction.

Backlash can be reduced to be almost visually
unnoticeable by precisely adjusting distance
between worm and sprocket wheel.

Tools required:

    Phillips screwdriver PH1
    Flat long screwdriver
    L-shaped Hex Allen wrench 2 mm
    Fork-shaped Hex nut wrench 7 mm

Backlash can be adjusted by minimal disassembly,
no wires need to be removed but hood has to be
released carefully and held by hands while unscrewing
big screws while being very gentle with wires.

With long flat screwdriver release the big cylindrical
flat screw by turning 180Â° counter-clockwise.
On the picture this flat screw is marked by red circle.

Not visible on the picture is a smaller black screw
touching the big screw, this screw has hex hole for
2 mm Allen wrench and is fixed in place by counter-tightened
7 mm nut which is additionaly fixed with lacquer.

With Hex Fork wrench and Hex Allen wrench break the
lacquer and release hex nut to allow some space for
adjustment, like 1 mm.

Partially assemble the mount to leave hood open for
access with Hex Allen wrench and to have neccesary
parts in place to hold the telescope tube. Launch
motor control software, set software backlash
correction to zero and use cursors to move telescope
by visually monitoring backlash.

Change distance of the worm from sprocket wheel
by turning the black screw with Hex Allen wrench
until backlash disappears.

That,s it! After carefully tightening and assembling
check that everying is still working.
