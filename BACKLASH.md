# Backlash Reduction

Backlash is annoying accumulated mechanical energy
in motor tranmission which visually manifests as
telescope first goes a few arc minutes in counter
direction than it goes in correct direction.

Backlash can be reduced to almost visually unnoticealby
by precisely adjusting distance between worm and
sprocket wheel.

Tools required:

    Phillips screwdriver PH1
    Flat long screwdriver
    L-shaped Hex Allen wrench 2 mm
    Fork-shaped Hex nut wrench 7 mm

Backlash can be adjusted with minimal disassembly,
no wires need to be removed but hood has to be released
carefully being very gentle with wires.

With long flat screwdriver release by turning 180Â°
counter-clockwise a big cylindric flat metallic screw,
on the picture marked by red circle. There is a smaller
black screw touching this big screw, this screw has hex
hole for Allen wrench and is fixed in place by
counter-tightened nut which is additionaly fixed
with lacquer.

With Hex Fork wrench and Hex Allen wrench break the
lackquer and release hex nut to allow some space for
adjustment like 1 mm.

Partially assemble the mount to leave hood open and
to have all the rest parts in place to hold the telescope
tube, launch synscan software, set software backlash
correction to zero and use cursors to move telescope
by Visually monitoring backlash.

Change distance of the worm from sprocket wheel
with turning the black screw with Hex Allen wrench
until backlash disappears.

That,s it! After carefully tightening and assembling
check that everying is still working.
